#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

(Linear) If the input is increased, the runtime will grow at the same rate


b) O(n^c)

(Polynomial) The run time will grow at a faster rate, (generally only good for small inputs)

c) O(log n)

(Logarithmic) The run time will grow at a slightly slower rate

## Exercise II
